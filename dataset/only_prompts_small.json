    "\\section{Introduction}\nQuantum Field theory in curved spacetime is a well-established branch of modern physics, which has allowed the achievement of novel results since Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation \\cite{Hawking}. Within this framework, we consider the quantum dynamics of fields in a gravitational background, considered as a classical external field. That is, all matter fields are considered using quantum field theory, with the only exception of the external gravitational field, that remains satisfying the classical Einstein field equations of General Relativity \\cite{DeWitt,birrel}.\n\nIn this context, an important role is played by the quantum stress energy tensor \\(\\langle T_{\\mu}^{\\nu}\\rangle\\) of the quantum field, which is used as a source in the so called semiclassical Einstein's equations to take a look at the quantum corrections to the background geometry caused by the quantization of matter fields \\cite{birrel,york,lousto-sanchez}. For this reason, it is very useful to have explicit analytical expressions for the renormalized stress tensor. This quantum stress tensor and the expectation value of the field fluctuation \\(\\langle\\varphi^{2}\\rangle_{ren}\\) of a quantum field \\(\\varphi\\) are the main objects to be determined from quantum field theory in curved spacetime.\n\nThe exact determination of \\(\\langle T_{\\mu}^{\\nu}\\rangle\\) for a generic spacetime is very cumbersome, and some techniques have been developed and applied to this problem, including numerical ones \\cite{candelas,koffman,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,owen1,owen2,Folacci,FT}. However, for the case of massive fields, there exist a method, called the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action approach, in which one assumes that the vacuum polarization effects can be separated from the particle creation, for masses of the fields sufficiently large. This method allow us to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action as an expansion in the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field. From the effective action, the quantum stress energy tensor can be calculated by functional differentiation with respect to the metric. This approach, based on proper time expansion of the Green's function of the dynamical operator that describes the evolution of the quantum field, can be used to investigate effects like the vacuum polarization of massive fields in curved backgrounds, whenever the Compton's wavelenght of the field is less than the characteristic radius of curvature \\cite{DeWitt,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,popov,owen1,owen2,Folacci}.\n\nIn a previous paper \\cite{owenmonopole1} we took the first step in the investigation of vacuum polarization effects of quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the gravitational field of a point-like global monopole, using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique to obtain analytical expressions for the field fluctuation \\(\\langle\\varphi^{2}\\rangle_{ren}\\) in this background spacetime. We used the simple model, discovered by Barriola and Vilenkin \\cite{barriola-vilenkin}, which leads to global monopoles as heavy objects appeared in the early universe as a result of a phase transition of a self-coupled scalar field triplet whose original global $O(3)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken to $U(1)$. In this systems, the scalar field plays the role of order parameter which is nonzero outside the monopole's core, where it is concentrated the main part of the monopole's energy.\n\nPrevious works that consider quantum fields in global monopole systems includes the analysis of massless scalar fields \\cite{hiscock,mazzitely-lousto,bezerra1}, and the calculation of the quantum stress energy tensor for a massless spinor field \\cite{bezerra2,bezerra3}.\n\nIn \\cite{owenmonopole1}, we construct various approximations for $<\\phi^{2}>$, each one proportional to the coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coeficcient $\\left[a_{k}\\right]$, starting from the leading term, proportional to $\\left[a_{2}\\right]$, up to the next to next to next to leading term, that include the coincident limits of coefficients up to $\\left[a_{5}\\right]$. In terms of the mass $\\mu$ of the quantum scalar field, the leading approximation lead to $<\\phi^{2}>$ proportional to $\\mu^{-2}$, whereas the higher order approximation involve powers $\\mu^{-8}$.  We also find the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor for the quantized field in the leading approximation, using the existing relationship between this magnitude, the trace anomaly and the field fluctuation.\n\nThe results obtained in \\cite{owenmonopole1} for the field fluctuations of the quantized massive scalar field in the global monopole background shows that taking into account higher order terms substantially improve the approximation, for which we concluded that for this spacetimes, we need to use the next to next to next to leading term to obtain a good description of the vacuum polarization.\n\nThis situation was in contrast with that obtained for other spacetimes with spherical symmetry, as the one describing a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, for which previous studies showed that the next to leading term, proportional to $\\left[a_{3}\\right]$, provides a reasonable good approximation \\cite{matyjasek4}.\n\nIn this paper we continue the study of vacuum polarization effects in the spacetime of the global monopole. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, we construct an analytic expression of the four dimensional renormalized quantum effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime. This expression, which is an expansion in powers of the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field, proportional to coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coefficient $\\left[a_{3}\\right]$, is used to obtain the leading approximation for the renormalized quantum stress energy tensor of the quantum field by functional differentiation with respect to the metric\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

    "\\section{Introduction}\n\nOne of the unresolved problems in fundamental physics is the problem of the electron's internal structure.\nIn classical physics, this problem manifests itself in the fact that a point charge possesses an infinite mass related to the energy\nof the electrostatic field created by the charge. In quantum electrodynamics, a point electron leads to the occurrence of divergences in loop graphs.\n\nApparently, a first attempt to resolve this problem has been made by Abraham and Lorentz within the theory of an electron suggested in Refs.~\\cite{ablo,ablo1}.\nAnother attempt to resolve the problem is Wheeler's idea of `charge without charge'~\\cite{wheelbook} where an electric charge is regarded as a\nwormhole containing force lines of an electric field. Within such model, the region where the force lines enter the wormhole looks like a negative charge,\nand the region where the force lines emerge from the wormhole mimics a positive charge. Also, numerous attempts have been made to find regular solutions\nin classical and nonlinear electrodynamics both in the presence  and in the absence of the gravitational\nfield~\\cite{Born:1934gh,heis,Markov:1970hv,Markov:1972sc,Bronnikov:1979ex,Datzeff:1980tg,Bonnor:1989iw,Davidson:1992kr,Herr:1994,Zaslavskii:2010yi,Finst:1999,Bronn:2000,Habib:2009,Zaslav:2010,Dzhunushaliev:2016bnh}.\nOne should also definitely mention the popular approach to the classical model of an electron using the Einstein-Dirac~\\cite{Finster:1998ws}\nand Kerr-Newman~\\cite{KNold,KNold1,KNold2,KNold3,KNold4,KNold5,KNold6,KNold7} solutions (an extensive bibliography on the subject can be found in Ref.~\\cite{Burinskii:2011id}).\n\nIn the present paper we consider a model of an electron on the assumption that its internal structure is determined by quantum gravitational effects.\nWe suppose that such effects can be approximately described by modified Weyl gravity suggested in Ref.~\\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom}.\nThis enables us to represent the electron as a composite object whose interior region is described by modified Weyl gravity and the exterior region~-- by Minkowski spacetime. In turn, in both regions, there is a Dirac spinor field that ensures the presence of a spin of $1/2$ in the system. To describe the interior region, we will use the solution obtained in  Ref.~\\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom} which is embedded in an exterior flat spacetime. In addition, notice that, since Weyl gravity (as well as modified Weyl gravity considered here) is conformally invariant, metrics differing by a conformal factor are the same solution. Physically this can be interpreted  as the presence in the interior region of fluctuations of the metric conformal factor\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

    "Boys and girls are driven by biology to play with toys that are traditionally aimed at their own gender, according to a new study.\n\nThe research found that an innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers.\n\nA similar inbuilt instinct may be the reason why girls have always liked to play with dolls, cosmetics or toys based on domestic life, it said.\n\nAn innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers\n\nBut the impact of feminism on parents, advertising and media may be a reason why girls have been less keen on dolls, make-up and kitchen toys in recent years, according to the research paper.\n\nGirls are more likely than boys to be influenced as they grow up by parents, the adults and children around them, and what they read and see on television, it said, while boys stick to boys\u2019 toys.\n\nThe study produced by a team led by psychologists from City, University of London, was based on evidence collected by different researchers across the Western world over decades, with some dating back to the 1930s.\n\nIt said: \u2018Despite methodological variation in the choice and number of toys offered, context of testing, and age of child, the consistency in finding sex differences in children\u2019s preferences for toys typed to their own gender indicates the strength of this phenomenon and the likelihood that it has a biological origin.\u2019\n\nThe paper added that there were robust differences between the toy choices of girls and boys, and that this was so across decades and in different experiments.\n\nThis, the study said, \u2018indicates an innate influence on this behaviour.\u2019\n\nThe findings come at a time of deepening controversy over the choice of toys made by children, and heightened awareness over transgender issues.\n\nThe study found that 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with more fashionable than traditional toys. Aeroplanes were popular, which may have been to do with Amelia Earhart (pictured) and other female aviators\n\nLast week the Church of England told schools that in the interest of avoiding transgender bullying, teachers in its schools should ensure \u2018a child may choose the tutu, princess\u2019s tiara and heels and/or the fireman\u2019s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment.\u2019\n\nThe City study said that even more than 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with toys that were more fashionable than traditional.\n\nIn 1932, an experiment \u2018found that girls played with a toy aeroplane for similar times to boys.\u2019\n\nThis may have been because at the time \u2018female aviators were in the news; Amy Johnson flew from England to Australia in 1930, and Amelia Earhart flew solo across the Atlantic in 1932.\u2019\n\nSome attempts to study children found that boys tended to play aggressively even if they were given traditional girls\u2019 toys.\n\n\u2018Other toys, not necessarily male-typed, can afford aggressive play,\u2019 the study said.\n\nIn 1980, it said, one set of psychologists \u2018noted in their observation that boys played with a toy food mixer as if it were a machine gun.\u2019\n\nIn recent times, girls have been less likely to play with dolls and other toys once considered female.\n\nThe Church of England told schools 'a child may choose the tutu, princess\u2019s tiara and heels and/or the fireman\u2019s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment'. Pictured: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby\n\n\u2018One interpretation is that , over the years, girls have been exposed to increasing pressure to play with neutral-typed toys as the volume of advertising to children and expansion on the number and type of children\u2019s media outlets have increased enormously,\u2019 it said.\n\nDr Brenda Todd of City, University of London, said: \u2018What we found is that as boys get older we see increased play with toys typed to their gender\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

    "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{intro}\n\nGravitational accretion of matter onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) that resides in the center of most, if not all, galaxies is what powers active galactic nuclei (AGN, \\citealt{Rees84}). This very efficient process produces large amounts of energy across the entire spectrum that can be detected at cosmological distances. Not only is radiation emitted, but also large amounts of matter are injected back into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. This process is known as feedback, and it is believed to play a major role in the coevolution of the SMBH and the galaxy (\\citealt{DM05}; \\citealt{HE10}).\n\nMore than half of the observed type-1 AGN present signatures of photoionized gas in their soft X-ray spectrum, the so-called warm absorbers (WA), that are seen as absorption features superimposed to the continuum (e.g., \\citealt{Rey97}; \\citealt{Geo98}; \\citealt{Cre03}). With the advent of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy after the launch of {\\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and {\\sl Chandra}{}, it was observed that these absorbers were blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of their host galaxy, typically by hundreds to thousands of km s$^{-1}$ (\\citealt{Kaa00}; \\citealt{Kas01}). Since they were outflowing, they were injecting kinetic energy and mass back into the ISM and therefore they were potential candidates to be a source of cosmic feedback. It is now considered that the regular WAs have, in general, little impact on their surroundings, with the exception of their most extreme version: outflows with very high velocity, ionization state, and column density, known as ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), which can have a significant impact on their host galaxy (\\citealt{Tom12, Tom13}; \\citealt{Laha16}).\n\nThe dominant launching mechanism of these outflows is still a matter of debate as they present a wide range of velocities, degrees of ionization, and column densities. They range from thermal winds arising the from inner edge of the torus, which is eroded by the intense radiation field (\\citealt{KK01}), and winds launched from the accretion disk by radiative means (\\citealt{PK04}) or magnetohydrodynamical mechanisms (\\citealt{KK94}; \\citealt{Fuk10a, Fuk10b}). In addition to this, after many years of observations and monitoring of AGN, another type of transient wind has been identified and studied: high-column density, fast, obscuring winds that eclipse the inner X-ray source of AGN on relatively short time scales. A number of objects have now shown this kind of transient phenomenon, for instance NGC 1365 (\\citealt{Ris07}), Mrk 766 (\\citealt{Ris11}), Mrk 335 (\\citealt{Lon13, Lon19}), NGC 5548 (\\citealt{Kaa14}), NGC 3783 (\\citealt{Meh17}), and now also NGC 985 (\\citealt{Ebr16}). \n\nNGC 985, also known as Mrk 1048, is a nearby ($z = 0.043$, \\citealt{Fis95}), bright ($F_{\\rm 0.3-10~keV} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-11}$~erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, \\citealt{Ebr16}) Seyfert 1 galaxy with a distinctive ring shape, produced by a recent galactic merger. This source is known to host a WA in X-rays (\\citealt{Kro05,Kro09}) as well as an UV absorber (\\citealt{Ara02}). During a {\\sl Swift}{}~monitoring program in 2013, the source was found to be in a very low soft X-ray flux state. A triggered joint {\\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST observation found that some intervening very dense gas was occulting the central X-ray source (\\citealt{Par14}). In the most recent observations in 2015, taken 12 days apart also with {\\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST, we found that the source was emerging from this obscured state. The first analysis of the X-ray broad band and UV spectra were presented in \\citet{Ebr16}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

    "A drive to provide lunches to at least 50 schoolchildren who otherwise would go without has been dealt a blow with none of the 300 Upper Hutt businesses contacted prepared to help fund the project.\n\nFourteen primary and intermediate schools in the area have teamed up with a local trust to create the programme Fuel the Need.\n\nPhoto: RNZ / Kate Gudsell\n\nFuel the Need is being run by Manuel Dalton, who runs the Dalton's Gym Charitable Trust, which in turn operates a community based gym in Upper Hutt City.\n\nMr Dalton is a self-described Upper Hutt boy, an ex-soldier with a philanthropic drive to help out the community where he was born and bred.\n\nAt the end of 2014 he met with principals from schools in the region so they could work out what the need was. The group deduced about 50 children a day were turning up to school without lunch, although he believed that could be on the conservative side.\n\n\"To me that was a big enough number to prompt me to do something about it.\"\n\nMr Dalton immediately got to work, getting the gym's chiller reinstated, having two people get food handling and hygeine certificates and getting approval in principle from the council to run the operations.\n\nThere is a database of about 20 people willing to volunteer their time to the programme, and a deal has been struck with Pak 'n Save to supply the food at $3 per lunch which includes a sandwich, yoghurt, and piece of fruit and a museli bar.\n\nThe programme needs about $30,000 a year funding. Mr Dalton has sent about 300 emails to local businesses, but has had only had two replies - both of which were a 'thanks, but no thanks'.\n\nMr Dalton said the response was disappointing and he planned to make further contact with businesses.\n\n\"I'm not trying to sound harsh but if there are businesses that are making money off our community then I'm sort of garnering towards making them socially responsible to give back to the community that it makes money from.\"\n\nTrentham School is one of the schools that would benefit from the initiative.\n\nThe decile 5 primary school has about 406 pupils for whom many English is a second language.\n\nTrentham's principal Suzanne Su'a said every week a handful of pupils turn up with empty stomachs and nothing for the day which has an impact on their learning and behaviour.\n\n\"For us to not have food at home that you can bring to school is a real concern, you know we deal with the five days a week, there's still the weekend.\"\n\nPhoto: RNZ / Kate Gudsell\n\nAt the beginning of every term the school makes sandwiches that it freezes and then defrosts when they are needed, but the school hopes the Fuel the Need initiative will supplement that.\n\nMrs Su'a said the number of children in need varies year from year. She describes it as quite a transient school with pupils coming in who will leave part way through the year, and others that return.\n\nShe said the school does not have hard data on why the children may not have food, but the teachers make judgements through observation and sometimes what the children say.\n\n\"For some it's purely just lack of money and trying to make their weekly budget stretch through, sometimes you can tell on certain days when kids don't have lunch, the benefit might not come through until the next couple of days so for a lot of our families it is to do with financial poverty, and then we might have some families who it comes down to poor management by parents in regards to finances.\"\n\nMrs Su'a was disappointed by the response from local businesses - as was the Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce which worked with Mr Dalton to help get the initiative off the ground.\n\nChief executive Mark Futter said it was a great concept and he was astounded no businesses had come forward to help.\n\n\"I'm genuinely surprised to be perfectly honest \n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.
