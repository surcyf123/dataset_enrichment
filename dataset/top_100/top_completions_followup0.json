This limitation ignores the distinctive concepts in images, limiting their application. Some recent works have focused on generating more diverse and descriptive captions, but these captions are poor at mimicking human language distinctiveness. The distinctiveness of a caption is evaluated using the retrieval metric in recent works, but self-retrieval can lead to repetition problems and variations in results depending on the retrieval model or candidate images pool.

It relates to vacuum polarization effects of massive fields by accounting for how particles interact with quantized fluctuations in their environment. The approach has been employed to obtain detailed analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action - this helps us understand phenomena such as spontaneous symmetry breaking, gauge theories, the cosmological constant problem, among others.
