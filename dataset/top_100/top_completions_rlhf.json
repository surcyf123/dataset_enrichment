However, Ars Technica reports that Nintendo is planning to make an important change that could ensure that its next major console doesn\u2019t face a dearth of good games during its launch period.\n\nNintendo President Satoru Iwata said recently that his company is working on a unified architecture for its next-generation consoles that will work across both its home console and portable console systems.

Offering such a high quality product with top of the line specs at that price surely isn\u2019t easy. After initial reports suggested Google would make zero profit on the tablet we now have additional details.\n\nNow this doesn\u2019t really matter for the individual consumer. All they need to know is the tablet is awesome, is $199, and a major bang for their buck. After a teardown by TechInsights the tablet\u2019s estimated production cost sits at around $184 per tablet. Roughly a $15 profit per device for Google/ASUS. It looks like that \u201cvirtually no profit margin\u201d statement might not have been completely accurate.\n\nWhen you add in all the additional R&D to hit that low price point, logistics, and many other factors that $15 probably gets gobbled up pretty quick. When Google said they weren\u2019t making any profit margin on the tablet \u2014 it was probably true. That is only the 8GB model however. The 16GB model is $249 when that additional 8GB of storage costs under $10 to produce, making the 16GB version profitable to the tune of around $55. With the increase to the Play Store they are hoping movies, magazines, books, and music are what drive sales and profit margins. This is the same approach Amazon took with the Kindle Fire, but the Nexus 7 blows it away.\n\nIt looks like sales from the Play Store and the 16GB version will offset any lack of profit from the lower alternative, and either way this was a great move by Google\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

(Handout/Amalgam Features)\n\nThis week, REI\u2019s chief executive learned that Reddit\u2019s \u201cAsk me Anything\u201d feature really means just that \u2013 anyone could participate, not just those who want to ask Jerry Strizke about the company\u2019s cool decision to stay closed during Black Friday so that employees can \u201cspend the day outdoors with loved ones.\u201d\n\nShortly after Strizke\u2019s thread opened for questions, some current and former REI employees began posting about what they described as the many downsides of working for the company. In particular, many were concerned that the company uses unfair employee performance evaluation standards.\n\nREI runs on a co-op model, and it sells memberships to that co-op to its customers. According to those posting in the thread, the number of memberships sold per shift is by far the biggest performance metric that seems to matter to the company \u2014 which would go against REI\u2019s self-styled image as a chain that values expertise in the products it sells, something that its Black Friday stunt is supposed to in part underline.\n\n\u201cHow many memberships you sell is the ONLY metric by which you will ultimately be measured. Product knowledge, customer service skills, overall work ethic are worth ZERO if you are not selling x number of memberships per shift,\u201d one former employee wrote.\n\nAfter Strizke\u2019s AMA time ended, the question remained unanswered. But he eventually returned, saying that \u201cMy team gave me a heads up that I missed an important question.\u201d He posted a mildly conciliatory response promising to look into how the company uses its membership sales to evaluate employees.\n\nBut, to a large extent, the damage had already been done before Strizke returned to address the issue. Gizmodo wrote up the whole debacle, highlighting the contrast between REI\u2019s message and how the company\u2019s employees felt about it. What was supposed to be an opportunity for Strizke to demonstrate REI\u2019s unique appreciation for the people who work there turned into something very different.\n\nStrizke, however, is hardly alone in hosting an AMA that suddenly goes wrong. There\u2019s an entire subreddit devoted to bad AMAs \u2013 r/AMADisasters.\n\nA quick glance at the subreddit shows a whole bunch of ways in which the question and answer sessions can go wrong, warranted and otherwise: sometimes angry redditors arrive en masse to flood an AMA of a person whose ideas they don\u2019t like. Sometimes, internal Reddit politics bomb an AMA. Sometimes, the subject is simply bad at the Internet\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

However, the thread turned into a platform for current and former employees to voice concerns about unfair employee evaluation standards. They claimed that the company focuses too much on the number of memberships sold per shift, which contradicts REI's image as a company valuing product expertise. The CEO initially missed the question but later returned to address the issue, promising to look into the use of membership sales in evaluating employees. This incident highlights the potential pitfalls of AMAs and how they can go wrong due to angry redditors, internal politics, or the subject's lack of Internet skills.",

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nIt appeared Hillary Clinton's private email scandal ended last month when the investigation was dropped by the Department of Justice and the FBI. Her campaign said Clinton could then concentrate on her race for the White House. But one conservative author and film producer says where one investigation closes, another one opens, and federal investigators are just getting warmed up.\n\nWith 13 weeks until the presidential election, the Clinton Foundation, the charity that claims to build unity worldwide between business, citizens and governments, is under investigation by the FBI -- this according to \"Clinton Cash\" author Peter Schweizer.\n\n\"I know that they are investigating the foundation,\" he said. \"I've met with them, but I can't talk about the details of that.\"\n\nSchweizer is tight-lipped about the alleged meeting. But he doesn't hold back in blasting the foundation in his newly released documentary based on the \"Clinton Cash\" book.\n\n\"They've created a model for massive self-enrichment that allows you to go into so-called public service, but get extremely rich at the same time,\" Schweizer says in the film.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the foundation has raised roughly $2 billion since 2001. But Schweizer claims a lot of that cash found its way into the Clintons' pockets through political and corporate favors, and astronomically high speaking fees worldwide, which he says caught the FBI's attention.\n\n\"I think what they're looking for is, you know, the flow of funds, the timing of the flow of those funds, and favors that were done that were, you know, unusual,\" he said.\n\nMeantime, the Clinton camp wasted no time firing back:\n\n\"Peter Schweizer is a Republican operative and friend of the Koch brothers with no credibility whatsoever,\" Hillary Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said Friday. \"He was widely discredited for making baseless accusations in his debunked 'Clinton Cash' book that even he admitted was not backed up by any evidence.\"\n\nStill, Schweizer says the FBI is forging ahead with an investigation, and even if there is a smoking gun, he questions what the attorney general or the Justice Department would do.\n\n\"Do they want to take on, you know, a very powerful family that has been in the public eye for decades?\" he said.\n\nIf Clinton wins the White House, Schweizer says the alleged investigation will quickly wind down\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

The Hillary camp responded to Schweizer's allegations calling him a GOP operative without credibility.\n5.

But who did the studio approach first before signing the Social Network star as the Man of Steel\u2019s new nemesis?\n\nSome new information about Warner Bros.' casting process has leaked out via The Hollywood Reporter, and it seems the studio first approached Girls co-star Adam Driver and Walk the Line star Joaquin Phoenix for the Man of Steel sequel.\n\nAccording to sources, Driver couldn\u2019t take the role because of a scheduling conflict, while Phoenix reportedly flirted with the idea but ultimately passed. At 30 years old, the same age as Henry Cavill and Eisenberg, Driver could\u2019ve been a good fit for a young Lex Luthor.

Hmm, okay, that is kind of interesting. As for all those other rumored casting options, from Bryan Cranston to Tom Hanks?

Krar wanted to know, \"Are we are going to see anything in the pipeline any time soon?\" Cook's response, which was shared on MacRumors, said:\n\nI'm glad you love the Mac mini. We love it too.

Apple used to offer a viable server configuration of the Mac mini, but that came to a stop with the 2014 update. It just hasn't been clear where the Mac mini fits in Apple's offerings or the marketplace at large. It's still not clear.\n\nAn ultra-cheap Mac with more updated specs could have some very niche prospects\u2014in classrooms, for example\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

She visits the police station, has celebrated her birthday there, and often wears her pint-size police uniform, even to the hospital.\n\n\u201cLeah rarely gets any cards in the hospital and we were hoping that you could help out by sending her a card,\u201d the Police Department announced on its Facebook page Friday. \u201cShe loves animals, horses, cars, Legos, and anything with a joke to it!\u201d\n\n\"She's a little geography buff, and she loves to see that people all over the country are thinking of her,\" Xiarhos said.\n\nLeah also is dealing with the recent loss of her father, who died of cardiac arrest April 6.\n\n\"She should be able to come home from the hospital by Wednesday, and YPD will be escorting her home with cruisers,\" Xiarhos said.\n\nCards may be addressed to: Junior Officer Leah Archambault, 10 Northwest, Boston Children's Hospital, 300 Longwood Ave., Boston, MA 02115\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.\n\n",
