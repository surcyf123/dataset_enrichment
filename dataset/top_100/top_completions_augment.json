Instead, Chromat cast a wide range of women \u2014 black, white, Asian, Latina, and a number of mixed-race models who were difficult to classify one way or the other. Not that this is anything new for Chromat. Designer Becca McCharen has made diversity a priority on her runways for a long time now \u2014 but after attending a dozen or so shows before this one that were overwhelmingly white, the diversity of Chromat's runway definitely made an impression.\n\nGetty Images\n\n4. The size diversity of the models. There are only a handful of designers who cast larger women in their shows \u2014 women who are closer to a size 12 than a size 2 \u2014 and when they do it, they usually only cast one. Chromat had two such models in their most recent show \u2014 Sabina Karlsson and Denise Bidot \u2014 and they didn't just walk in the show, they opened and closed it, respectively. It was awesome.\n\nSabina Karlsson Getty Images\n\nDenise Bidot Getty Images\n\nWith all that going on, I'm going to confess that Wasser's gold prosthetic leg managed to fly under my radar.

Toddlers will spontaneously bob along with music, but you never see dogs or cats listen to a tune and tap their tails in time.\n\nSo a couple of years ago, a neurobiologist named Aniruddh Patel was astonished when someone e-mailed him a link to a YouTube video of a sulfur-crested cockatoo named Snowball dancing to the Backstreet Boys.\n\n\"I said, you know, this is much more than just a cute pet trick.

Schulz put a video of the bird dancing online and it went viral, with millions of people watching him on YouTube.\n\n\"I felt like OK, this could be real,\" says Patel. But he wanted to test Snowball to see if the bird could really adjust his movements to match a different beat. After all, maybe Snowball just did a trained routine at one tempo that just happened to go with certain songs.\n\nPatel's group took Snowball's beloved Backstreet Boys song and manipulated it with a computer. They slowed it down and sped it up. They sent the modified music to Schulz, who played it for Snowball and videotaped his reactions.\n\nThe videos show that yes, the bird will match his moves to the beat. For the slower versions, he sways his entire body like a pendulum. But, Schulz says, when the music gets faster, \"he understands to adjust his movements.

Recently, Tech spoke with HipHopDX about the potential success of the project. \u201cThe blessing is I\u2019m still doing music, and people still want to hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the most that I\u2019ve sold preorders on any release that I\u2019ve ever had, and this is a Collabos disk, not a solo.

More or less abandoned at the turn of the millennium, the car was quietly retired from production but for many it was never forgotten.\n\nFord Cortina (2.4 Million +)\n\nThis vintage beauty is commonly associated with 1960s Britain but made its true sales mark in the 1970s where it came out on top as the best selling UK car of the decade. The large family car went through several updates over its 20 year manufacturing history (ceasing in 1982) with five prominent generational redesigns. It was revealed in 2009 that the Cortina remains the third (possibly fourth now) most popular car sold in the UK and at the time of its production passing only faced competition notable competition from the second generation Vauxhall Cavalier. The car still retains a cult following.\n\nFord Focus (1.7 Million +)\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t quite caught up with the Ford Escorts \u2018everyman\u2019 sales feat, the Focus is a consistent, reliable seller with wide demographic appeal. Beautifully designed, efficient and with a generous enough design to suit families both large and small, it strikes the perfect equilibrium between class and convenience.

        "prompt": "A wolf pack is roaming wild in Denmark for the first time in more than 200 years after a young female wolf journeyed 500km from Germany.\n\nMale wolves have been seen in Denmark since 2012 and the new female could produce cubs this spring in farmland in west Jutland after two wolves were filmed together last autumn.\n\nIt is further evidence that the wolf is returning to well-peopled landscapes after centuries of persecution, with wolf packs also re-establishing themselves in France and Germany and individuals sighted in Holland and even Luxembourg. Before the new population, Denmark\u2019s last wolf was killed in 1813.\n\n\u201cWe expect that they will have cubs this year or the next,\u201d said Peter Sunde, a senior researcher at Aarhus University.\n\n\u201cPeople were very surprised when wolves first appeared in Denmark but they are highly mobile and are just as adaptable to cultural landscapes as foxes are. The only problem historically is that we killed them.\u201d\n\nDNA from two faeces samples have confirmed that the female wolf came from a pack 25km south of Berlin in Germany before travelling to north-west Denmark, probably leaving her family group last spring to do so.\n\nThere is sometimes speculation that wolves are deliberately released into the countryside by unofficial rewilders but according to Guillaume Chapron, a researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, this female\u2019s trek north was entirely natural. \u201cThe wolf went on its four legs, it makes complete biological sense,\u201d he said. Wolves can walk 50km in 24 hours and have been recorded making journeys of more than 1,000km across Europe from Germany, where they re-established themselves in 1998. Germany\u2019s wolf population is currently growing at 25-30% each year, with the young dispersing across central Europe.\n\nResearchers have found wolves in some cases living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre \u2013 higher than the population density of Cambridge or Newcastle.\n\n\u201cThe wolf is a predator to the roe deer \u2013 if you can have roe deer, you can have wolves,\u201d said Chapron. \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t disturb them, they will be fine in these human-dominated landscapes. In Denmark there\u2019s no reason wolves can\u2019t thrive. But the question has to be asked, are people going to accept the wolves? The wolf will need to eat something. When they realise that Danish sheep don\u2019t taste too bad that may be a little problematic. It will be interesting to see how far we can coexist with big predators.\u201d\n\nDenmark\u2019s wolves have settled in a well-farmed area of heathland and small pine plantations with plentiful prey in the form of burgeoning populations of red and roe deer.\n\nThere have been reports of wolves killing several sheep in the area over winter but the Danish government has already established a wolf management plan with compensation for farmers and funding so livestock farmers can erect wolf-proof fencing. The management plan, drawn up in consultation with game hunters as well as farmers and conservationists, allows for wolves that become \u201chabituated\u201d and live too close to humans to be controlled.\n\n\u201cThere is a tradition in Denmark of reaching compromises and reaching solutions,\u201d added Sunde, who said he was optimistic that Danes could coexist peacefully with wolves. \u201cTechnically, we can relatively easily manage the wolf population but the challenge is the psychology of humans. There are so many feelings and opinions about wolves in Denmark, as everywhere. The wolf debate is very much value-driven rather than related to concrete problems.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 12,000 wolves in continental Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus) and the wolf is a protected species under the EU\u2019s habitats directive. According to Chapron, southern European countries have often been better at accepting new wolf populations than northern Europe\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

PNe are probes of stellar and nebular evolution and of cosmic chemical enrichment, and knowing their formation and evolution is essential in many astrophysical fields.\n\nTo date, several hundred Galactic PNe are known (e.~g., catalogs by Acker et al.~1992; Parker et al.~2006), but their distances have always been elusive. Reliable independent distances are known for a relatively small number of Galactic PNe (Stanghellini et al.~2008, hereafter SSV) if we exclude those whose distances are model dependent (Frew et al.~2016, hereafter F16). Since the PN distance is needed to study the astrophysics of the nebulae and their CSs, scientists in the field have recurred to calibrate physical relations between distance-dependent and distance-independent astronomical parameters of the PNe. Once these relations have been calibrated for the few PNe with a credible independent distance determination, they are used as a distance scale, yielding distances to all Galactic PNe whose distance-independent parameters used in the scale can be measured.\n\nThe Galactic PN distance scales are typically derived by using a measure of the PN surface brightness (or its inverse, the optical thickness) as the independent parameter, and with the physical radius (e.~g., Schneider \\& Buckley 1996; Shaw et al.~2001; F16) or the ionized mass (e.~g., Daub 1982; Cahn et al\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

It would mandate that income above $2 million would be taxed at least at a 30 percent rate, with a graduated boost in the minimum marginal rates for income between $1 million and $2 million. The GOP-led House is not expected to take up the bill, and it is thus not expected to become law.\n\nSeventy-four percent of Democrats, 63 percent of independents and 43 percent of independents told Gallup they support the Buffett Rule as articulated by Gallup. Fifty-four percent of Republicans opposed the rule.\n\nMr. Obama and his allies have been pushing the Buffett Rule in what appears in part to be an attempt to frame the general election. They has been casting the president as a fighter for economic fairness and presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a defender of a status quo that allowed Romney to pay an effective tax rate of just 13.9 percent on $21.7 million in income in 2010. While Mr. Obama wants to raise taxes on some of the highest earners via the Buffett Rule, Romney is proposing a tax cut for the highest earners.\n\nMr. Obama and first lady Michele Obama released their 2011 joint tax return on Friday, which showed they paid an effective rate of 20.5 percent on an adjusted gross income of $789,674. They would not have been impacted by the Buffett Rule had it been in effect during the 2011 tax period.\n\nThe Buffett Rule is named after wealthy investor Warren Buffett, who argues that it is wrong for a billionaire such as himself to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.\n\nIn a separate Gallup poll last April, 59 percent of adults said they support increasing taxes on households making $250,000 or more per year. If the Bush-era tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of the year, taxes will go up on all Americans. Mr. Obama favors letting those tax cuts expire for households making more than $250,000 per year, but extending them for those making less than that threshold; Republicans want to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

By combining individual layers of atom the material produces a thin film having magnetic polarity which can be flipped from positive to negative or the other way around with small electricity pulses.\n\nResearchers claim that device-makers could use this property in the coming days to store digital 0's and 1's.\n\nThe demand for the room-temperature multiferroic is huge in the electronics filed as they require a less amount of power to read and write data than what the current semiconductor-based computers need. Besides, when power is shut, the data remains intact. And, because of these properties multiferroic devices require only brief pulses of electricity as against the constant stream that's needed for today's electronics. The new devices would use an estimated 100 times less energy.\n\nRamamoorthy Ramesh, associate laboratory director for energy technologies at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said: \"Today, about 5 percent of our total global energy consumption is spent on electronics, and that's projected to grow to 40-50 percent by 2030 if we continue at the current pace and if there are no major advances in the field that lead to lower energy consumption.\"\n\nTo create the new material, researchers used thin and film of hexagonal lutetium iron oxide (LuFeO3). \"We were essentially spray painting individual atoms of iron, lutetium and oxygen to achieve a new atomic structure that exhibits stronger magnetic properties,\" said Darrell Schlom, a materials science and engineering professor at Cornell.\n\nJohn Heron, assistant professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, said a viable multiferroic device is not likely soon, although the initiative taken in the field puts it closer to its goal of making computer with improved speed\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

Located around 550 kilometres (340 mi) north of Adelaide and about 200 kilometres (120 mi) inland, it has been identified as the oldest known site of human habitation in inland Australia.[2] Newspapers reported that this rock shelter was discovered by chance in 2011 by a local resident who stumbled upon it while looking for somewhere to go to the toilet. Researchers found thousands of artefacts and bone fragments, which enabled them to date the shelter's occupation to a number of periods between 49,000 and 10,000 years ago. The finds include the earliest evidence in Australia of the development of bone and stone-axe technology, the use of ochre, and interaction with megafauna such as Diprotodon.\n\nDiscovery [ edit ]\n\nThe site is located in the ancestral lands of the Adnyamathanha, an Indigenous Australian people. It lies in a gorge at the southern end of the Lake Eyre basin in the northern Flinders Ranges.[3] Its discovery came about by chance during an exploratory trip into the Flinders Range by Clifford Coulthard, an Adnyamathanha elder, and Giles Hamm, an archaeologist from La Trobe University.[4]\n\nWhile Coulthard was searching for a place to go to the toilet, the two men found a spring surrounded by rock art and a soot-blackened fissure in the rock nearby.[3] They realised immediately that the soot indicated that the fissure had been used as a shelter where fires had been lit.[4] The fissure is located about 20 metres (66 ft) above a creek bed.

        "prompt": "Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) or ice structuring proteins (ISPs) refer to a class of polypeptides produced by certain animals, plants, fungi and bacteria that permit their survival in subzero environments. AFPs bind to small ice crystals to inhibit growth and recrystallization of ice that would otherwise be fatal.[3] There is also increasing evidence that AFPs interact with mammalian cell membranes to protect them from cold damage. This work suggests the involvement of AFPs in cold acclimatization.[4]\n\nNon-colligative properties [ edit ]\n\nUnlike the widely used automotive antifreeze, ethylene glycol, AFPs do not lower freezing point in proportion to concentration.[citation needed] Rather, they work in a noncolligative manner. This phenomenon allows them to act as an antifreeze at concentrations 1/300th to 1/500th of those of other dissolved solutes. Their low concentration minimizes their effect on osmotic pressure.[4] The unusual properties of AFPs are attributed to their selective affinity for specific crystalline ice forms and the resulting blockade of the ice-nucleation process.[5]\n\nThermal hysteresis [ edit ]\n\nAFPs create a difference between the melting point and freezing point (busting temperature of AFP bound ice crystal) known as thermal hysteresis. The addition of AFPs at the interface between solid ice and liquid water inhibits the thermodynamically favored growth of the ice crystal. Ice growth is kinetically inhibited by the AFPs covering the water-accessible surfaces of ice.[5]\n\nThermal hysteresis is easily measured in the lab with a nanolitre osmometer. Organisms differ in their values of thermal hysteresis. The maximum level of thermal hysteresis shown by fish AFP is approximately -3.5 \u00b0C (Sheikh Mahatabuddin et al, SciRep)(29.3 \u00b0F). However, insect antifreeze proteins are 10\u201330 times more active than fish proteins. This difference probably reflects the lower temperatures encountered by insects on land. In contrast, aquatic organisms are exposed only to -1 to -2 \u00b0C below freezing. During the extreme winter months, the spruce budworm resists freezing at temperatures approaching -30 \u00b0C.[4] The Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides can survive in a temperature of -60 \u00b0C by using antifreeze agents that are not proteins.[6]\n\nThe rate of cooling can influence the thermal hysteresis value of AFPs. Rapid cooling can substantially decrease the nonequilibrium freezing point, and hence the thermal hysteresis value. Consequently, organisms cannot necessarily adapt to their subzero environment if the temperature drops abruptly.[4]\n\nFreeze tolerance versus freeze avoidance [ edit ]\n\nSpecies containing AFPs may be classified as\n\nFreeze avoidant: These species are able to prevent their body fluids from freezing altogether. Generally, the AFP function may be overcome at extremely cold temperatures, leading to rapid ice growth and death.\n\nFreeze tolerant: These species are able to survive body fluid freezing\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

He did not once mention Trump's name.\n\nThe University of Chicago hosted the event, billed by Obama's office as a \"conversation on community organizing and civic engagement.\" The highly anticipated public appearance happened just days ahead of the symbolically significant 100-day mark for Trump -- a milestone that one Obama adviser insisted is \"far from\" the former president's mind.\n\nIn fact, Obama made clear on Monday that he has little interest so far in reemerging as a figure and spokesperson for the Democratic Party, notably declining to comment on issues like health care and foreign policy.\n\n\"I'm spending a lot of time thinking about what is the most important thing I can do for my next job?\" Obama said onstage. \"The single most important thing I can do is to help in any way I can prepare the next generation of leadership, to take up the baton, and to take their own crack at changing the word.\"\n\nWhile Obama did not intend to directly confront or take swipes at Trump on Monday, an adviser said he wanted to be forthcoming -- if asked -- about where he stands on specific policy matters, including areas where he and Trump clearly disagree, a source said.\n\nThe closest Obama got to wading into a politically charged issue was when he discussed immigration, as he referred to many undocumented workers as simply \"families who are looking for a better life for their children.\"\n\n\"It's not like everybody on Ellis Island had all their papers straight,\" Obama said. \"The truth is, the history of our immigration system has always been a little bit haphazard, a little bit loose.\"\n\nObama, 55, reflected on the fact that when he came to Chicago more than 30 years ago as a 25-year-old, he was \"filled with idealism and absolute certainty that somehow I was going to change the world.\"\n\n\"But I had no idea how,\" Obama said. \"I am the first to acknowledge that I did not set the world on fire. Nor did I transform these communities in any significant way.\"\n\nHe later joked that the famous line from his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 -- that there are not red states or blue states, but that there is rather one united country -- was an \"aspirational comment.\"\n\nObama also took on several political and cultural developments that he lamented were exacerbating the country's divisions, including gerrymandering, money in politics and the politicization of media.\n\n\"The internet in some ways has accelerated this sense of people having entirely separate conversations,\" Obama said. \"If you're liberal, then you're on MSNBC. If you're a conservative, you're on Fox News.\"\n\nHe even shared a warning with young people about their prolific use of social media.\n\n\"If you had pictures of everything I'd done in high school, I probably wouldn't have been President of the United States,\" he said. \"I would advise all of you to be a little more circumspect about your selfies and what you take pictures of.\"\n\nIn the final stretch of the 2016 election, Obama actively campaigned for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

Located around 550 kilometres (340 mi) north of Adelaide and about 200 kilometres (120 mi) inland, it has been identified as the oldest known site of human habitation in inland Australia.[2] Newspapers reported that this rock shelter was discovered by chance in 2011 by a local resident who stumbled upon it while looking for somewhere to go to the toilet. Researchers found thousands of artefacts and bone fragments, which enabled them to date the shelter's occupation to a number of periods between 49,000 and 10,000 years ago. The finds include the earliest evidence in Australia of the development of bone and stone-axe technology, the use of ochre, and interaction with megafauna such as Diprotodon.\n\nDiscovery [ edit ]\n\nThe site is located in the ancestral lands of the Adnyamathanha, an Indigenous Australian people. It lies in a gorge at the southern end of the Lake Eyre basin in the northern Flinders Ranges.[3] Its discovery came about by chance during an exploratory trip into the Flinders Range by Clifford Coulthard, an Adnyamathanha elder, and Giles Hamm, an archaeologist from La Trobe University.[4]\n\nWhile Coulthard was searching for a place to go to the toilet, the two men found a spring surrounded by rock art and a soot-blackened fissure in the rock nearby.[3] They realised immediately that the soot indicated that the fissure had been used as a shelter where fires had been lit.[4] The fissure is located about 20 metres (66 ft) above a creek bed. It is approximately 10 metres (33 ft) wide and extends to a depth of about 4 metres (13 ft).[5]\n\nFinds [ edit ]\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, a team of researchers led by Hamm excavated the shelter to a depth of 1 metre (3.3 ft). They found over 4,300 artefacts including bone fragments from sixteen species of mammal and one reptile,[4] as well as eggs from emus[2] and an extinct giant bird, Genyornis newtoni.[6] The animal remains included bones from the extinct Diprotodon, a wombat-like creature the size of a rhinoceros, which had probably been killed and brought to the shelter to be cooked and eaten.[4] Most of the 3 kilograms (6.6 lb) of bones discovered were probably from a single species, the yellow-footed rock-wallaby\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

It would mandate that income above $2 million would be taxed at least at a 30 percent rate, with a graduated boost in the minimum marginal rates for income between $1 million and $2 million. The GOP-led House is not expected to take up the bill, and it is thus not expected to become law.\n\nSeventy-four percent of Democrats, 63 percent of independents and 43 percent of independents told Gallup they support the Buffett Rule as articulated by Gallup. Fifty-four percent of Republicans opposed the rule.\n\nMr. Obama and his allies have been pushing the Buffett Rule in what appears in part to be an attempt to frame the general election. They has been casting the president as a fighter for economic fairness and presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a defender of a status quo that allowed Romney to pay an effective tax rate of just 13.9 percent on $21.7 million in income in 2010. While Mr. Obama wants to raise taxes on some of the highest earners via the Buffett Rule, Romney is proposing a tax cut for the highest earners.\n\nMr. Obama and first lady Michele Obama released their 2011 joint tax return on Friday, which showed they paid an effective rate of 20.5 percent on an adjusted gross income of $789,674. They would not have been impacted by the Buffett Rule had it been in effect during the 2011 tax period.\n\nThe Buffett Rule is named after wealthy investor Warren Buffett, who argues that it is wrong for a billionaire such as himself to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.\n\nIn a separate Gallup poll last April, 59 percent of adults said they support increasing taxes on households making $250,000 or more per year. If the Bush-era tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of the year, taxes will go up on all Americans.

Pat Quinn must decide if he will sign a measure allowing the use of marijuana for medical purposes after the state Senate approved legislation on Friday.\n\nThe proposal has been touted as the strictest in the nation among states that have legalized medical marijuana. It authorizes physicians to prescribe marijuana to patients with whom they have an existing relationship and who have at least one of more than 30 medical conditions listed on the measure.\n\nLawmakers voted 35-21 to send the measure to the Democratic governor. Quinn has declined to say whether he will support the bill, saying he\u2019s \u201copen-minded\u201d on the issue. Lt. Gov. Sheila Simon, a former prosecutor, said she is in favor after meeting with patients, including veterans.\n\nThe proposed legislation creates a framework for a four-year pilot program that includes requiring patients and caregivers to undergo background checks. It sets a 2.5 ounce limit per patient per purchase and calls for 60 dispensaries regulated by the state where patients could buy the drug.\n\nSupporters of the legislation say it is a compassionate measure that could save patients from the agony caused by illnesses such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and HIV.

The publication in September of The Grand Design, a book the British physicist co-authored with Leonard Mlodinow of Caltech, raised hackles as some saw it as denying the existence of God based on scientific arguments.\n\nPhysics, the book states, can now explain where the universe came from and why the laws of nature are what they are. The universe arose \u201cfrom nothing\u201d courtesy of the force of gravity, and the laws of nature are an accident of the particular slice of universe we happen to inhabit. \u201cIt is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings,\u201d the authors wrote. (An adaptation of the book appeared in the October Scientific American.)\n\nTheologians were incensed, saying that the existence of a creator is by definition outside science\u2019s domain. Some, including Reverend Robert E. Barron, a theology professor at the University of St. Mary of the Lake near Chicago, also complained that the book is philosophically naive. For example, Barron says, the existence of the laws that caused the appearance of the universe must have predated the big bang. \u201cThe \u2018laws of gravity\u2019 seem to be something other than nothing.\u201d\n\nAs the media frenzy spread from bloggers and tweeters to prime-time television, the authors countered that they never meant to claim that science proved that there is no God. \u201cGod may exist,\u201d Hawking told CNN\u2019s Larry King, adding, \u201cbut science can explain the universe without the need for a creator.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t say we\u2019ve proved that God doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Mlodinow says. \u201cWe don\u2019t even say we\u2019ve proved that God hasn\u2019t created the universe.\u201d As for the laws of physics, he says, some may choose to call those God. \u201cIf you think that God is the embodiment of quantum theory, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the scientific account of the origin of the universe may not be as complete as Hawking represents. It is based on string theory and on an even more mysterious\u2014and just as untested\u2014version of it called M-theory, as well as on Hawking\u2019s own cosmological thoughts. \u201cThe theories that Hawking and Mlodinow use to base their arguments on have as much empirical evidence as God,\u201d wrote cosmologist Marcelo Gleiser on an NPR.org blog. Moreover, Gleiser added, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have instruments capable of measuring all of nature, we cannot ever be certain that we have a final theory.\u201d\n\nStanford University theoretical physicist Leonard Susskind, whose 2006 book The Cosmic Landscape also questioned the need for a creator in the account of creation, agrees. \u201cNot all physicists think the quest for a complete theory is over,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are anywhere near it\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

        "prompt": "President Obama is urging passage of the so-called \"Buffett Rule,\" which would ensure that high income Americans pay at least 30 percent in taxes.\n\nA new survey from Gallup has found that Americans favor President Obama's \"Buffett Rule\" proposal by a wide margin, with 60 percent saying they favor the rule and 37 percent opposing it.\n\nIn asking the question, Gallup did not actually use the term \"Buffett Rule.\" Here's how the question was asked: \"Would you favor or oppose Congress passing a new law that would require households earning $1 million a year or more to pay a minimum of 30 percent of their income in taxes?\"\n\nThat conforms to the way President Obama has been describing the proposal, though the version of the bill set for a Senate vote on Monday is slightly more complicated. It would mandate that income above $2 million would be taxed at least at a 30 percent rate, with a graduated boost in the minimum marginal rates for income between $1 million and $2 million. The GOP-led House is not expected to take up the bill, and it is thus not expected to become law.\n\nSeventy-four percent of Democrats, 63 percent of independents and 43 percent of independents told Gallup they support the Buffett Rule as articulated by Gallup. Fifty-four percent of Republicans opposed the rule.\n\nMr. Obama and his allies have been pushing the Buffett Rule in what appears in part to be an attempt to frame the general election. They has been casting the president as a fighter for economic fairness and presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a defender of a status quo that allowed Romney to pay an effective tax rate of just 13.9 percent on $21.7 million in income in 2010. While Mr. Obama wants to raise taxes on some of the highest earners via the Buffett Rule, Romney is proposing a tax cut for the highest earners.\n\nMr. Obama and first lady Michele Obama released their 2011 joint tax return on Friday, which showed they paid an effective rate of 20.5 percent on an adjusted gross income of $789,674. They would not have been impacted by the Buffett Rule had it been in effect during the 2011 tax period.\n\nThe Buffett Rule is named after wealthy investor Warren Buffett, who argues that it is wrong for a billionaire such as himself to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.\n\nIn a separate Gallup poll last April, 59 percent of adults said they support increasing taxes on households making $250,000 or more per year. If the Bush-era tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of the year, taxes will go up on all Americans. Mr. Obama favors letting those tax cuts expire for households making more than $250,000 per year, but extending them for those making less than that threshold; Republicans want to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

        "completions": "President Obama is promoting the Buffett Rule, which would ensure that high income Americans pay at least 30% in taxes. A recent Gallup poll shows that a majority of Americans support this proposal. If passed, the rule would apply to households earning over $1 million per year. However, since the GOP-led House is unlikely to take up the bill, it may not become law.",

        "prompt": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nObamacare\u2019s moment of truth is coming. By now we\u2019ve heard all the scare stories about a few health insurers in a few states requesting gigantic rate hikes for next year. But over the next few weeks, states are going to start publishing the actual average rate increases that consumers will see in 2016. California released its report today. It\u2019s still marked preliminary, but you can expect that the final numbers will be very close to these:\n\nI\u2019ve highlighted two numbers. First, the overall average rate increase is 4.0 percent. That\u2019s way lower than you\u2019ve seen in the scary headlines. And this is for a state that makes up more than a tenth of the country all by itself.\n\nSecond, the price of the second-lowest-price silver plan has gone up 1.8 percent. This is the figure used to calculate subsidy levels, so it\u2019s an important one. In fact, here\u2019s an interesting consequence of that number: because subsidies will be going up roughly 1.8 percent, and the cost of the lowest-price silver plan is going up only 1.5 percent, the net cost (including subsidies) of buying the cheapest silver plan is actually going down. As you can see in the bottom row, if you shop for the lowest-priced plan, your premiums are likely to decrease about 4.5 percent.\n\nI have a feeling this number is not going to be widely reported on Fox News.\n\nNow, California isn\u2019t necessarily a bellwether for all the other states. Because it\u2019s the biggest state in the union, it has lots of competition that helps drive down prices. A big population also means less variability from year to year. Also: California\u2019s program is pretty well run, and the California insurance market is fairly tightly regulated. All this adds up to a good deal for consumers.\n\nIn any case, the headline number here is a very reasonable 4 percent increase in overall premiums, and a 4.5 percent decrease for consumers shopping for the cheapest plans. These are real statewide numbers, not cherry-picked bits and pieces designed to encourage hysteria\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.
