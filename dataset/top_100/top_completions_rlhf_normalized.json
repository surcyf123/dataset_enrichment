Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Amidst growing concerns over what\u2019s being described as potentially the worst environmental catastrophe in US history, a senior BP executive admitted in a closed-door congressional briefing Tuesday that the ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico could be gushing as much as 60,000 barrels of oil a day. That\u2019s more than ten times the initial estimate of the flow of 5,000 barrels a day.\n\nThe White House did not comment on BP\u2019s hour-long briefing with Congress. But earlier Tuesday, President Obama said his administration is committed to containing the economic damages the slick is set to inflict on local residents, oyster farmers, fishermen and tourism.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We are committed to preventing as much of the economic damage as possible by working to contain the impact of this potentially devastating spill. In addition, wherever possible, I would like to see the people most affected by the disaster employed in helping in the cleanup, and we will continue to explore every possible option to create jobs and support local economies in the Gulf, while continuing to monitor any potential effects on the national economy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, the expanding oil slick has hit the shores of Louisiana\u2019s Chandeleur Islands, a wildlife refuge sixty miles from New Orleans. With the slick now reportedly less than thirty miles from the Alabama and Mississippi coasts, fishermen and residents from across the Gulf Coast are bracing for the impact.\n\nLOUIS McANESPY: I worked thirty years at my business, building my business up. I have boats, oyster reefs. I can\u2019t even do nothing with it. I can\u2019t even sell \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even give my boat away right now. This industry looks like it\u2019s shot.\n\nDWAYNE VAHAL: The whole end of the parish pretty much depends on getting in on the water in some shape or form, you know, whether it\u2019s oysters, crab, shrimp, charter fishing. So it could affect everybody, you know? Could cripple the parish, pretty much.\n\nMIKE BERTHOLO: We\u2019re going to be in bad, bad trouble. There\u2019s nothing for us to do. I mean, Mother Nature\u2019s going to take its course, no matter what. And I don\u2019t think the way it\u2019s spilling into the Gulf, I don\u2019t see no chance of them cleaning up the mess. And it could put us out of work for two to three years, maybe, who knows, maybe longer. Because they ain\u2019t really telling us what\u2019s going on out there. They\u2019re just telling you what you want to hear.\n\nFRANCES LACROSS: It\u2019s just like Katrina, catastrophic. That\u2019s how it feels.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Tyson Slocum is the director of Public Citizen\u2019s Energy Program\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

The blast cut the hydraulic lines that make controlled flight possible. Fitch got down on his knees and used all his strength to manipulate the plane's throttles, while both Haynes and Records struggled with the yoke, the steering wheel.\n\nFitch died this week at age 69, losing a battle with brain cancer. But on that hot summer day 23 years ago, he and the two other pilots wrenched the jet toward an Iowa airport without the hydraulics required for steering.\n\n\"I think what you had was three men desperately trying to get what control they can of the aircraft,\" said Jim Burnett of the National Transportation Safety Board during a news conference after the crash.\n\nDesperate is right. The captain found that the only way to control the plane was by varying the thrust of the engines. Even then, the plane could only veer toward the right.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption James Finley/AP James Finley/AP\n\n\"Varying their thrust gave the pilots some crude control over the aircraft's elevation,\" reporter Bill Zahren wrote in the Sioux City Journal three days later. \"But it was in the form of 'porpoising' or repeated rising and falling of the plane like a porpoise swimming and then coming up for air every so often.\"\n\nWith Fitch on his knees at the throttles and Records and Haynes both trying to use the yoke, the plane managed to stay aloft while making a series of 360-degree turns to the right as it approached the airport in Sioux City.\n\nBurnett told reporters that air traffic controllers said the plane was \"nearly normal\" as it approached the tarmac. Emergency crews were standing by along with TV news crews.\n\nA Survivor Sheds Her Regrets Enlarge this image toggle caption StoryCorps StoryCorps\n\nAll three men in the cockpit had strapped themselves into seats for the landing. Witnesses say the right wing dipped slightly and hit the ground, sending the plane into cartwheels and into a cornfield between runways.\n\n\"I was 46 years old the day I walked into that cockpit,\" Fitch later said in a documentary about the crash. \"I had the world ahead of me.

He is currently writing a book on the making of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society. Follow him @joshuamzeitz.\n\nLast week, Peter Shulman, an associate professor of American history at Case Western Reserve University, caused a political stir when he tweeted results from a Fortune Magazine poll dated July 1938. \u201cWhat\u2019s your attitude towards allowing German, Austrian & other political refugees to come into the US?\u201d Fortune asked its survey audience. Over two-thirds of respondents answered in the negative.\n\nShulman\u2019s tweet went viral, igniting a spirited debate about whether opposition to welcoming Syrian refugees is morally or situationally equivalent to American indifference in the 1930s toward Jewish victims of the Nazi state. In what can only be described as a sharp reversal of prevailing norms, many conservatives, who these days seem inclined to liken every government overreach to Nazism, are incensed by the analogy, while many liberals, who have grown accustomed to rolling their eyes each time that Bill Kristol invokes the Munich Agreement, are sticking by it.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo is the analogy a good one? In short, yes. Contrary to what conservatives are saying these days, language commonly invoked in opposition to admitting Syrian refugees bears striking similarity to arguments against providing safe harbor to Jewish refugees in the late 1930s. Then as now, skepticism of religious and ethnic minorities and concerns that refugees might pose a threat to national security deeply influenced the debate over American immigration policy. For conservatives, this likeness is an inconvenient truth.\n\nBut the analogy doesn\u2019t stop there.

        "completions": "Rolling Stone published an article about a gang rape at the University of Virginia, but it was filled with problems. The article didn't interview the alleged rapists or the victim's friends, and when other news outlets investigated, the story was found to be untrue. The Poynter Institute labeled it as the \"error of the year\" due to confirmation bias and poor handling by Rolling Stone. The magazine initially blamed the accuser in a poorly worded response, then removed the line without acknowledgment. Rolling Stone did not specify which parts of the article were wrong or how they planned to correct it. The incident is considered a cautionary tale in journalism.",
