\\section{Introduction}\nThe current generation of short pulse lasers reach intensities beyond $\\mathrm{I} > 10^{20}\\ \\mathrm{W/cm^2}$, and hold great potential for many applications in high energy density science such as high energy x-ray backlighters and particle beams\\cite{Note1}\\cite{Note2}. While lower intensity lasers couple their energy into the transverse motion of electrons, relativistic electrons can couple energy into longitudinal motion via the laser's magnetic field. However, as intensity increases on relativistic laser platforms, the long ns pre-pulse pedestal that arrives prior to the main interaction intensifies as well. This pre-pulse, generated by amplified spontaneous emission processes in the laser, typically has an intensity contrast ratio $\\mathrm{(I_{Main Beam}/I_{Pre-Pulse})}$ of $10^{6}$. In high intensity interactions this results in a pre-pulse of high enough intensity to ionize material, creating an underdense pre-plasma that extends for hundreds of\\SI{}{\\ \\micro\\meter}. \n\nWhile pre-plasma has been seen as detrimental to electron acceleration for applications such as fast ignition due to filamentation and self focusing instabilities\\cite{MacPhee}\\cite{Sunahara}, it actually can be beneficial in other ways, enabling a number of mechanisms that can generate energetic electrons. Accelerating electrons is the primary way to couple the energy in a laser to a plasma and provides the basis for a wide range of phenomena and applications. The generation of large quantities of x-ray and energetic secondary particles, such as ions \\cite{Pomerantz}, neutrons\\cite{Schollmeier} and positrons\\cite{Chen} highly depend on relativistic electrons. The electron acceleration in these experiments occur in a regime where the plasma response time is short compared to the laser pulse. In these experiments the density profile evolves slowly relative to the laser and develops into a quasi-steady state, opposite of the regime necessary for processes such as wakefield acceleration. Therefore, understanding the parameters that control the quantity, energy and trajectory of these electrons is critical to properly understanding the production of other energetic particles from secondary interactions.\n\nA common element for electron acceleration mechanisms is the important role played by quasi-static transverse and longitudinal pre-plasma electric fields in enhancing the energy transfer from the laser pulse to pre-plasma electrons \\cite{Booshan1}-\\cite{Robinson}. These fields are relatively weak compared to the field of the laser pulse and are unable to directly transfer considerable energy to the electrons. However, they do change the phase between the oscillating electric field of the laser and the electron velocity, which can result in a net energy gain with each laser period. This is the essence of the mechanism called direct laser acceleration (DLA) that leads to acceleration of the so-called super-ponderomotive electrons in an extended pre-plasma. These electrons have a corresponding relativistic $\\gamma$-factor greatly exceeding the conventional estimate of $\\gamma \\approx a_0^2$, where $a_0$ is the normalized laser amplitude. Indeed it has been shown that these super-ponderomotive electrons can enhance the energy of target normal sheath accelerated (TNSA) protons for radiography purposes but requires carefully controlled conditions for the rise time and trajectory of the electron beam \\cite{Kim}. \n\nPrior experiments using pulses with durations of 150 fs \\cite{Peebles},400 fs \\cite{Tanaka}, 500 fs \\cite{Toshi} and 700 fs \\cite{Ma} suggest that appreciable quantities of super-ponderomotive electrons should be accelerated for pulse lengths 400 fs or longer. The goal of the experiment presented here was to fill a gap between theory and experiment by accelerating large quantities of super-ponderomotive electrons using a very high intensity Texas Petawatt (TPW) laser while varying the interaction pulse length\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

Here is a summary of the given text in four sentences:\n\n1. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has offered to provide an additional $500 million in funding over four years to help save the Metrorail system if Virginia, DC, and the federal government match this amount.\n2. This offer represents a significant shift from Hogan's previously stated position at a recent regional summit where he refused to consider adding funds beyond those currently contributed annually by Maryland.
